# Matrix Rotation Challenge

You are given an image represented by an N x N matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes. Your task is to write a method that rotates the image by 90 degrees clockwise. The challenge is to perform this rotation in-place, meaning you should modify the original matrix without using additional data structures.
